### Response: PHONES AND DRIVING

I think that people should be allowed to use cell phones and driving because it would be safer and safer. People would be able to use their phones and drive because they would be able to call their friends and family and they would be able to text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and text and
